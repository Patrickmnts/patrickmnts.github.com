        <h3>The Right Tool for the Right Job...</h3>
          <p>One of the most pleasent experiences thus far in my brief history with code has been to discover and use of all the wonderful tools that the industry has built to ease the pain of web-design.  When faced with a problem that makes me wish I could simply reach into the monitor and place an object where I want it, these keep my sanity intact.  Plus, I enjoy giving myself the best chance to avoiding the dreaded experience of going down in flames... Even with the knowledge it can bring.
          </br></br>Here is a highlight of my top 5 thus far:</p>
          <p><strong><a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap">Twitter Bootstrap:</a></strong> A beautiful & EASY framework for creating webpages.  While bootstrap screams its name, and it is not hard to spot, once you learn the standard 12 grid layout and class keywords, you are up and running, making acceptable looking pages in minutes.  With brilliant documentation, guides and helpers, it is way more fun than fighting pixles the old fashioned way.</p>
          <img class="image" id="righttool" src="img/RightTool.jpg" alt="Right tool for the job.">
          <p><strong><a href="http://www.rubular.com">Rubular:</a></strong>  A regular expression generator for Ruby!!! Eliminate all of the guessing and checking with one of the most powerful tools in our tool box.  Talk about a life saver...</p>
          <p><strong><a href="http://kuler.adobe.com">Kuler:</a></strong>  If you're like me and you have a hard time generating themes and color combinations, this might just be perfect.  Take a picture of a beautiful landscape and Kuler will give you the Hex codes for all of the dominant colors in the scene.  While I obviously did not use this for a standard B&amp;W layout, you will definitely see Kuler themes from me in the future!</p>
          <p><strong><a href="http://www.github.com">Github:</a></strong>:  If you do anything with anybody and code, I am sure you have heard of/use Github religiously.  It is the easiest way to share and backup your work one could ever imagine.  All it takes is a "git push origin master" in your terminal and your code is instantly available for others to collaborate with, and manipulate.  An opensourcerers savior!</p>
          <p><strong><a href="http://christophheer.me/2012/7/30/dash-documentation-browser-for-mac/">Dash:</a></strong>  All of our documentation in one easy to search, easy to use App.  We just download our needed Docs and they are there for us to search through with zero hang-ups or hubbub.  Free to download, cheap to turn off the heckles.</p>

        <h3>Pleasure to meet you!</h3>
          <p>Three weeks ago I began my stint at the <strong><a href="http://www.portlandcodeschool.com">Portland Code School</a>.</strong>  A personal project that came far too quickly &amp; has been as rewarding, as it has been challenging, to put it lightly.  I have the pleasure to experience one of my favorite aspects of "immersive" programs, the team aspect that undoubtably arises.  Just thinking about the bond that forms amoungst groups of complete strangers, from all walks of life, through a desire to be entirely engrossed in a topic, brings a smile to my face.  Even if we are dealing with something that can be, at times, as frustrating as anything imaginable.</p>
          <p>It's magical thing.  A good group dynamic has the power to bring you up, to fuel a desire to out do your own expectations and to become something great. I look forward to these next couple of months here at PCS and I look forward to getting this stream of consciouness up and running. <strong> I apologize in advance for all of the misspellings and grammatical errs.</strong></p>
          <p> I leave you with an image to symbolize my stress relief, who could argue.</p>
