        <h3>Pleasure to meet you!</h3>
          <p>Three weeks ago I began my stint at the <strong><a href="http://www.portlandcodeschool.com">Portland Code School</a>.</strong>  A personal project that came far too quickly &amp; has been as rewarding, as it has been challenging, to put it lightly.  I have the pleasure to experience one of my favorite aspects of "imersive" programs, the team aspect that undoubtably arises.  Just thinking about the bond that forms amoungst groups of complete strangers, from all walks of life, through a desire to be entirely engrossed in a topic, brings a smile to my face.  Even if we are dealing with something that can be, at times, as frustrating as anything imaginable.</p>
          <p>It's magical thing.  A good group dynamic has the power to bring you up, to fuel a desire to out do your own expectations and to become something great. I look forward to these next couple of months here at PCS and I look forward to getting this stream of consciouness up and running. <strong> I apologize in advance for all of the misspellings and grammatical errs.</strong></p>
          <p> I leave you with an image to symbolize my stress relief, who could argue.</p>
